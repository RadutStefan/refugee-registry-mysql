# Refugee Registry Database (MySQL Project)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is a structured refugee registration database created in MySQL. It simulates a real-world data registry with multiple connected tables and insights into personal details, health, ID verification, skills, experience, and family ties.

It was created as part of a university data analysis course, with the goal of replacing Microsoft Access with a more powerful and flexible system.

## ðŸ§± Technologies
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Tools**: MySQL Workbench / phpMyAdmin / CLI
- **Language**: SQL

## ðŸ“‚ Main Features
- 8 relational tables (refugees, towns, health info, ID documents, language skills, work experience, family links)
- Data insertion with 55+ refugee records
- Foreign key constraints and indexes for fast querying
- 8 SQL Views for analysis & reporting
- Filtering by vaccination status, profession, language proficiency, referral readiness, and more

## ðŸ“Š SQL Views Include:
- `unvaccinated_refugees`
- `vaccinated_refugees`
- `refugee_employment_language`
- `refugee_family_links`
- `referral_readiness_report`
- `refugee_count_by_profession`
- `refugee_count_by_town`
- `health_reports`

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Import `refugee_registry.sql` into your MySQL environment.
2. Run the full script to create the database, tables, data, and views.
3. Use the provided `SELECT * FROM ...` queries to explore results.

## ðŸ§  Learning Outcome
This project helped me dive deep into SQL design, query logic, and data modeling. It was also my first real-world implementation of a self-taught skill â€” and it inspired me to pursue a future in **data analytics**.
